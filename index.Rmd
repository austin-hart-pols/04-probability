# The goal is inference

> Statistical inference is the process of using sample statistics to learn about properties of a broader population.
  
- Used for 
  - describing an unobserved/unobservable population  
  - differentiating systematic vs random patterns
  
- Two approaches to statistical inference:  
  - Interval estimation: construct a plausible range around your estimate.   
  - Hypothesis testing: calculate probability of observing your sample stat given some assumption about the population.

# Know your distribtuions

1. **Population**: Dist of all data from a population of cases.  
  - Key target of inference.   
  - Typically unobservable.  
2. **Sample**: Dist of data from your observable sample.  
  - Starting point for inference about population.  
  - *What's the role of sample size???*  
3. **Sampling distribution**: Distribution of *ALL* possible sample stats.  
  - Basis of statistical inference.  
  - Theoretical but oh so necessary.

# Interlude: Normal curves
### Standard scores


- $Z$ score: distance from mean expressed as number of standard deviations

$$
Z_i = \frac{y_i - \bar{y}}{s_y}
$$

- Eileen scored a 27 on the ACT. Nina scored 1300 on the SAT. Who did better?
  - Mean ACT score = 21, sd = 5
  - Mean SAT score = 1050, sd = 300

# Interlude: Normal curves
### As probability distribution

```{r normaldist, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, dpi=350}
  ggplot(NULL, aes(c(-3,3))) +
    geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, fill = "#00998a", alpha = .5, xlim = c(-4, 4)) +
    labs(x = "Distance from mean (Z)", y = "Probability") +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL,
                       expand = expansion(mult=c(0,0.05))) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-3:3)) +
    coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-3.1,3.1)) +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())

# Central Limit Theorem (and demo)

- Let $X_1, X_2, ... , X_n$ be a statistical sample of size $n$ from a population with an average $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$.  

- Let $\bar{X}_n$ represent the the mean score of $X$ from a sample of size $n$.

- CLT: As $n$ approaches infinity, $\bar{X}_n \xrightarrow[]{d} N(\mu,\sigma^2/n)$
  - Sample means follow a normal distribution. 
  - Mean of sampling dist is $\mu$.   
  - SD of sampling dist is estimable: $SE=\sigma/\sqrt{n}$.

# Inference
### Key concepts

- Significance: $\alpha =$ Probability of rejecting true hypothesis. Typically set at $0.05$.

- Confidence: $(1-\alpha) * 100\% =$ probability of accepting a true hypothesis 

- Standard error: Standard deviation of a sampling distributi   on  

- $p$ value: probability of observing sample statistic of some magnitude from a defined population

# Interval estimation: embracing uncertainty

### Construction
  
$$
\begin{aligned}
CI &= \bar{y} \pm Z_{\alpha/2}  * \sigma_{\bar{y}}\\
\\
95\% CI &= \bar{y} \pm 1.96 * \sigma_{\bar{y}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

### Elements

- Sample stat: sample mean, $\bar{y}$

- Standard error, sample mean: $\sigma_{\bar{y}} = \frac{s_y}{\sqrt{n}}$

- Margin of error: For 95% confidence: $1.96 * \sigma_{\bar{y}}$ 

- Why it works...

# Hypothesis testing

> A method of inference that provides a basis for rejecting a hypothesis based on the plausibility of the data observed. 

&nbsp;

### Procedure

1. Specify null/research hypotheses

2. Set criteria for rejecting the null

3. Compute test statistic  

3. Conclude

---
# Setting up hypotheses

- **Research hypothesis,** $H_A$

- **Null hypothesis,** $H_0$

- TIPS
  - ALWAYS frame hypotheses in terms of parameters
  - Science is all about the null. 
  
---
# Select, test, decide

> A test statistic is a number that summarizes how far your sample information is from the parameter value in the null hypothesis.  

.pull-left[
### Which test?  
- $t$ statistic for
  - sample mean
  - difference of means
  - OLS regression coefficient
- Tabular analysis: $\chi^2$
]

.pull-right[
### Decision rule for rejecting

- Choose significance, typically $\alpha = 0.05$  

- Reject null if $p \leq \alpha$  
- Fail to reject otherwise

# t-test in action (population mean)

- I have data for ONE numeric variable.
- I want to test hypotheses about a population mean. $\mu$

### Our task
- Data: Afrobarometer, Round 9 
- Question: Q78A, China's influence good/bad

# Population mean (t-test)

### Setup

.right-column[
> Does the population believe that China's political and economic influence is positive? 

- State hypotheses
  
- Identify test statistic
  
- Set decision rule
  
- Calculate test statistic and p-value
  
- Reject/fail to reject the null

    ch_inf = if_else(Q78A %in% 1:5, Q78A, NA)

- Reject or not?

> I reject the null and conclude that the population views China's influence positively. It is unlikely that we observe our sample mean of 3.9 by chance alone (t = 35, p < 0.05, one-sided).
